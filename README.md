# Brain-tumor-segmentation
Utilizing the U-net to train on images and their corresponding masks of tumors
The dataset used to train the model can be extracted here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilroxtomar/brain-tumor-segmentation 
The repository includes a folder with four examples of the original image, the ground truth mask, and the segmented part from my model.
I have included one example of the how my model segments the pixels of interest in the notebook.
